##Where to get software

There are many different software packages available for working with GIS data. Below is a list of several packages.

###ArcGIS

Developed by ESRI, ArcGIS is a comprehensive software package with many extensions for analyzing GIS data. The software can be costly, but discounted and free trial versions can be obtained. There are many tutorials online and the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting offers classes teaching how to use the software.

Operating Systems: Windows

Cost: Basic package begins at $1,500

###QGIS

QGIS is the open source, free version of ArcGIS. At one point in time it was not as good as the commercial software package, but it has grown into a robust set of software with many free plugins to enhance its capabilities.

Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux

Cost: Free

###GDAL and OGR

GDAL and OGR are command line tools for working with geographic data. The tools are fast and can be used directly in Python. Many features in QGIS rely on these tools for functionality. There is a slight learning curve if you are not familiar with using the command line.

Operating Systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux

Cost: Free

###PostGIS and PostgreSQL

PostGIS is a extension for PostgreSQL that brings geographic data analysis to the popular database manager. Together the two are the foundation for  [GeoDjango](http://geodjango.org/), a Python-based framework. Installing both PostGIS and PostgreSQL can be complicated and it employs its own flavor of SQL to operate.
